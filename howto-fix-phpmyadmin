Manual Method:

Open sql.lib.php file

nano /usr/share/phpmyadmin/libraries/sql.lib.php

Find for count($analyzed_sql_results['select_expr'] code on file. You can get this at line ~613. You can see this below wrong code

|| (count($analyzed_sql_results['select_expr'] == 1)

Just replace that wrong code with this below one

|| ((count($analyzed_sql_results['select_expr']) == 1)
