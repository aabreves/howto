HOW TO CREATE A NEW PROJECT FROM SCRATCH

create a new project called "pathfinder"

1-Start it with git init

		git init pathfinder

	# this command will create the pathfinder directory and repository.
	# the created directory is not intended to be the real project directory; instead it
	#	is a root directory to all versions of this project

2-Next

		cd pathfinder
		git init pathfinder-v1.0		# note the version tag

	# this command will create the real project directory and also a repository to it.

	# if in the future we create a new pathfinder version...

		git init pathfinder-v2.0                # note the version tag

	# this will give us the following directory tree:

___________pathfinder/
		/
		\___pathfinder-v1.0/
		/
		\___pathfinder-v2.0/
