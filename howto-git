How to use git (based on https://www.codementor.io/git/tutorial/git-github-tutorial-for-beginners)

1-Config

	git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	git config --global user.email your_email@email.com


2-Create a repository

	git init project_name		# in this case the the project_name directory will be created

	#if the directory already exists, change to it and run the command

	cd project_name
	git init


3-Create a project description file (README.md)

	sudo vim README.md

		edit the file....

4-Add the file to the Staging Area
	When you add new files to your project, git does not track them.
	You have to add them to the staging area first using git add. The staging area stores information
	and lets you control precisely what will go into your next commit.

	git add README.md

5-Commit the file

	git commit -m "Initial message"
